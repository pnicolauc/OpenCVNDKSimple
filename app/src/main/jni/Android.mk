# The CLEAR_VARS variable is provided by the build system and points to a
# special GNU Makefile that will clear many LOCAL_XXX variables for you
# (e.g. LOCAL_MODULE, LOCAL_SRC_FILES, LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES, etc...),
# with the exception of LOCAL_PATH. This is needed because all build
# control files are parsed in a single GNU Make execution context where
# all variables are global.

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

# The LOCAL_MODULE variable must be defined to identify each module you
# describe in your Android.mk. The name must be *unique* and not contain
# any spaces. Note that the build system will automatically add proper
# prefix and suffix to the corresponding generated file. In other words,
# a shared library module named 'foo' will generate 'libfoo.so'.

# The flag "-Wno-write-strings" removes warnings about deprecated conversion

# The LOCAL_SRC_FILES variables must contain a list of C/C++ source files
# that will be built and assembled into a module. Note that you should not

# that will be passed directly to a compiler.

# instructions) mode, resulting in potentially faster yet somewhat larger
# binary code.

# BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY is a variable provided by the build system that
# points to a GNU Makefile script being in charge of collecting all the
# information you have defined in LOCAL_XXX variables since the latest
# 'include $(CLEAR_VARS)' statement, determining what and how to build.
# Replace it with the statement BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY to generate a static
# library instead.
